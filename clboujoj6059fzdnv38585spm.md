# Think you know Docker? Think twice

I stumbled upon the amazing website of Ivan Velichko:

%[https://iximiuz.com/en/] 

This guy really goes into the details of understanding Docker, Kubernetes pods, and lots more, usually by redoing manually (using a terminal) what those tools do under the hood. The articles are fun and easy to read, with nice cute diagrams which make the complexity of the subjects easy to swallow.

## Want to test your knowledge ? Game's on !

If you think you understand Docker, I dare you to read his article *Learning Containers From The Bottom Up* and tell me you didn't learn a thing ! But to make it fun, let's play a game.

Without cheating, try explaining the following (all sections of the article):

1.  Containers Are Not Virtual Machines
    
2.  Images Aren't Needed To Run Containers but containers are needed to build images
    
3.  Some Containers are Virtual Machines
    
4.  *extra*: containerd vs. docker
    

ðŸ‘‰ Post your answers in the comment and let the game begin ! ðŸ‘ˆ
